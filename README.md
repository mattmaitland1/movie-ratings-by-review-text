In this project, we explore both supervised- and
unsupervised-learning techniques for multi class sentiment
classification by augmenting a dataset with some labeled
samples, and some unlabeled samples. Many approaches are explored, 
but the most successful technique was iterative approach of only augmenting the training data with highly probable predicted labels.

See midterm_project.ipynb for implementation and writeup.pdf for in depth description and analysis.
